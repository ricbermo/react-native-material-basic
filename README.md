# react-native-material-basic
 A Simple set of React Native components following Material Design.

 I'm not the author of any of the components found on this library. I just copied them and put them together as a single installable library.
 I also patched some issues reported on the respective repos.

 The original repos, with no particular order are:

 1. https://github.com/n4kz/react-native-material-dropdown
 2. https://github.com/n4kz/react-native-material-textfield
 3. https://github.com/n4kz/react-native-material-ripple
 4. https://github.com/n4kz/react-native-material-buttons
 5. https://github.com/hectahertz/react-native-material-dialog


 Eventually, I'll add my own set of components but that may take some time.


### Dependencies

1. [react-native-vector-icons](https://github.com/oblador/react-native-vector-icons#installation)
2. [react-native-typography](https://github.com/hectahertz/react-native-typography)
